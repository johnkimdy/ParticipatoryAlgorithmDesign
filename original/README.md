Analysis of effects of participatory design on algorithm acceptance (Alex Chouldechova, Lingwei Cheng, John Kim)

I have created separate mechanical group R files that are referenced in server.R
server.R randomizes the groups the user is assigned to once they log in. We need to create
interfaces for once they log in in the server.R, then clean it up in ui.R.
